RSO/AUTH PLAN:

Step 1: When /player-stats command is used a unique link (sent via DM for privacy) to start the RSO OAuth process will 
begin.

Step: 2 The user will be directed to the Riot OAuth page.

Step: 3 We will use this to verify their account ownership to link their riot account to the bot for verification and approval of usage of their stats.

Step: 4 /player-stats command shall show the players stats from the custom scrims we hosted, as long as they give permission.
